X - "Optimized" collision detection with collision grid
	dsiabled by default, compile with -D COLLISION_GRID to enable it.
	this actually has a hit on performance and it gets worse with more entities : firing x2 with the wizard = big lag.
	reason: collision grid management has a big overhead (arrays manipulation each time we update the position of an entity)
	vs the benefit of scanning a smaller list for collision. not worth it at all.
